# MLPAgents

The previous project "TilemapGen" focused on having entities able to move around and sense the environment.

The project "HaxeMLP" focused on having a simple feedforward Multilayer Perceptron.

This project will try to connect the two together.

Built using Haxe + HaxeFlixel + Echo (physics) + HaxeUI (interface).

## Live Build - Broken :(

Check out the [latest html5 build of the project](https://Gioele-Bencivenga.github.io/MLPAgents) if you want, but know that it may be broken or unusable.
