# TO DO

open a document and write down what you want to do/test/observe (how something affects fitness/herding behaviour/age/whatever)

what things you could adjust
how the change affects the objective

guess/say what you think will happen as a consequence of the change and then gather data. Analyze data to check whether you were right.

Minimum 5 repetitions (reruns with same parameters) for each major change.

This is called testing the model (changing model parameters). Once the best configuration is found you can experiment with changing the environment, resources ecc.

Choose how you want to decide what is good: max fitness reached ever by single entity? overall fitness increase of population? high minimum fitness reached by entities? ecc.

Old age

- Give higher old age (DONE), note down how many agents reach old age instead of dying from it.
- Fix mutation rate, mutating each connection is too much (DONE).
- Write down a test plan (what values you're gonna measure, then measure ecc).
- Tests you have done so far belong in preliminary testing, don't ignore them.
- Write down updated table of values, outlining how you've done reproduction, who gets chosen and why, mutated by how much, how many resources and rate of replenishing ecc..

try slower agents when full of energy (fat)
